# joshIsDev Docs

These are my developer notes! My name is Josh and these are my notes on web development. A lot of these notes tie back to Django in some way, which is my go-to framework for building web applications. My memory is mostly limited to topics I like, and even though I really like webdev I still forget tons of stuff Without writing it down. Notes organization is a little messy but broken down into a few categories:

- **DevOps** - Linux, Git, Docker, Application deployment, etc.
- **Programming (with Python)** - Programming and Python notes
- **Django** - Everything Django
- **System Design** - web architecture and backend/database notes
- **Frontend** - from HTML to Next.js
- **Misc** - Editors, Web security, Web history, and some Business notes

I only occasionally work on these docs so updates and additions will be slow. Here are some of the note ideas I have, but many will be scrapped or just take forever for me to write:
