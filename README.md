# [joshIsDev Docs](https://joshisdev.netlify.app/)
This if my personal documentation wiki where I store my notes on programming, software development, and anything in the same ballpark

I like to add new entries when I explore new technologies, but less consistent with updating sub-topics as I continue to grow. 

List of topics to add to wiki (In rough order)
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Docker
- React
